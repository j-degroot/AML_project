/Users/mrsalwer/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages/sklearn/linear_model/stochastic_gradient.py:183: FutureWarning: max_iter and tol parameters have been added in SGDClassifier in 0.19. If max_iter is set but tol is left unset, the default value for tol in 0.19 and 0.20 will be None (which is equivalent to -infinity, so it has no effect) but will change in 0.21 to 1e-3. Specify tol to silence this warning.
